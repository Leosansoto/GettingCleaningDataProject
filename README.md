# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability acquired after the course to collect, work with and clean a datasets preparing them for analysis.

## Overview

The project is oriented to one of the most exciting areas data science today, wearable computing.
With the raw data from experiments done in this area we are aim to produce a tidy data set ready for analysis.

The base information to understand it all can be obtained from here:

## General Guidelines

We should create one R script called run_analysis that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Information

Of course, one cannot have a clear idea of all this without additional and deep details, those can be found on the Codebook.MD included in this repo.
